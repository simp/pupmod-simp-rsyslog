## Overview

[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog) configures
and manages RSyslog versions 7 and newer as built into either
[RHEL](http://www.redhat.com/en) or [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) versions
6 and 7. It is designed to work with [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) version
3.4 or newer.

*NOTE:* This version of
(pupmod-simp-rsyslog)[https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog]
is a complete re-write of the previous version, and as such there are no
guarantees made about backwards compatibility.

## This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the
[System Integrity Management
Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our
[JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our
[Contribution
Guide](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP)
and visit our
[developer
wiki](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home).


## Module Description

This module follows the standard
[PuppetLabs module style guide](https://puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html)
with some SIMP-specific configuration items included for managing auditing,
firewall rules, logging, SELinux, and TCPWrappers. All of these items are
configurable and can be turned on or off as needed for each user environment.

[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog) was designed
to be as compatible with RSyslog v7-stable as possible, though the version that
comes stock with RHEL or CentOS is slightly dated and as such legacy code still
exists. Where possible, all legacy code is documented with the new
configuration commented out to show how any updates going forward will look.

It is possible to use
[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog) on its own
and configure all rules and settings as you like, but it is recommended that
the
[SIMP Rsyslog
Profile](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp/tree/master/manifests/rsyslog)
be used if possible. By default, this profile will setup security relevant
logging rules and manage server/client configurations.

## Setup

### What pupmod-simp-rsyslog affects

Files managed by
[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog):
* /etc/rsyslog.conf
* /etc/rsyslog.simp.d

In addition to these, the `rsyslog::rule::<all>` definitions will create
numbered directories in the `$rsyslog_rule_dir`, by default
`/etc/rsyslog.simp.d`. These directories are included in alphanumeric order and
using the `rsyslog::rule` definition, the user can specify any directory name
they want to impact order.

Services and operations managed or affected by
[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog):
* rsyslogd
* auditd (configurable)
* iptables (configurable)
* TCPWrappers (configurable)
* SELinux (configurable)
* Logrotate (configurable)

Packages installed by
[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog):
* rsyslog
* rsyslog-gnutls

### Setup Requirements

*NOTE:* This version of
[pupmod-simp-rsyslog](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-rsyslog)
is a complete re-write of the previous version, and as such there are no
guarantees made about backwards compatibility.


It is *strongly* recommended that the logging infrastructure be set up in a
resilient manner. Failover in RSyslog is tricky and choosing the wrong kind of
queuing with failover could mean losing logs. This module attempts to protect
you from that but will allow you to change the queuing mechanism to meet your
local requirements.

### Beginning with pupmod-simp-rsyslog

Including rsyslog will install, configure, and start the rsyslog daemon on a
client:

```puppet
  include ::rsyslog
```

Including rsyslog::server will additionally configure the system as an Rsyslog
server.

```puppet
  include ::rsyslog::server
```

## Usage

*WARNING:* The version of rsyslog that is included with EL6 and EL7 systems is
*not* the final stable upstream release. In particular, TLS may only be enabled
or disabled *globally*, not per ruleset or action!

pupmod-simp-rsyslog is meant to be extremely customizable, and as such there is
no single best way to use it. For the SIMP specific recommendations on how to
use RSyslog (and other modules as well), check out the
[SIMP profile](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp).

### I want standard remote logging on a client

An example of an RSyslog client configuration may look like the following,
including possible file names and a simple remote rule to forward all logs on
the system.

```puppet
  class {'rsyslog':
    log_server_list      => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
    failover_log_servers => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
  }
```

Alternatively, this can be set as the default via Hiera:

```
# Send to *all* of these servers!
log_servers:
  - first.log.server
  - second.log.server
failover_log_servers:
  - first-failover.log.server
  - second-failover.log.server
```

```puppet
  include ::rsyslog
```

### I want to send everything to rsyslog from a client

```puppet
class my_rsyslog_client {
  class {'rsyslog':
    log_server_list      => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
    failover_log_servers => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
  }

  rsyslog::rule::remote { 'send_the_logs':
    rule => '*.*'
  }
}
```

### I want to disable TLS/PKI/Logrotate

```puppet
class my_rsyslog_client {
  class {'rsyslog':
    log_server_list      => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
    failover_log_servers => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
    enable_tls_logging   => false,
    enable_logging       => false,
    enable_pki           => false,
  }
```

### I want to set up an RSyslog Server

```puppet
class my_rsyslog_server {
  class {'rsyslog':
    log_server_list      => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
    failover_log_servers => ['first.log.server','second.log.server'],
  }

  include '::rsyslog::server'

  rsyslog::template::string { 'store_the_logs':
    string => '/var/log/hosts/%HOSTNAME%/everything.log'
  }
}
```

Using the above, all possible logs sent from the client will be stored on the
server in a single log file. Obviously this is not always an effective
strategy, but it is at least enough to get started. Further customizations can
be built to help manage more logs appropriately. To learn more about how to use
the templates and rules, feel free to browse through the code.

While this setup does cover all of the basics, using the SIMP suggested RSyslog
profile will setup templates and a large set of default rules to help organize
and send logs where possible. Included would also be a comprehensive set of
security relevant logs to help filter important information.

### I want to set up an Rsyslog Server without logrotate/pki/firewall

```puppet
  class {'rsyslog::server':
    use_iptables       => false,
    enable_selinux     => false,
    enable_tcpwrappers => false,
  }
```

### Central Log Forwarding

Following on from the first example, you may have an upstream server to which
you want to send all logs from your collected hosts.

To do this, you would use a manifest similar to the following on your local log
server to forward everything upstream. Note, the use of a custom template.
Upstream systems may have their own requirements and this allows you to
manipulate the log appropriately prior to forwarding the message along.

```puppet
rsyslog::template::string { 'upstream':
  string => 'I Love Logs! %msg%\n'
}

rsyslog::rule::remote { 'upstream':
  # Send Everything
  rule     => '*.*',
  # Use the 'upstream' template defined above
  template => 'upstream',
  # The Upstream Destination Server
  dest     => ['upstream.fq.dn'],
  require  => Rsyslog::Template::String['upstream']
}
```

## Limitations

This module is only designed to work in RHEL or CentOS 6 and 7. Any other
operating systems have not been tested and results cannot be guaranteed.

By default, `pupmod-simp-rsyslog` tries to do the right thing during a failover
scenario and make sure that logs are always stored no matter what the state of
the remote log server(s) is. Be careful if you opt out of the default queuing
strategy for failover as it may cause undesirable results such as lost logs.
