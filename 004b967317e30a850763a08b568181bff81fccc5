It seems more like a `wait_for_text_to_show_up_in_a_file()` or `grep_with_a_burning_fuse()`, because it isn\u0027t particularly log-specific (and wouldn\u0027t work with logs from services like journald or auditd).  But I don\u0027t know of a more precise name that clearly describes its purpose than `wait_for_log_message, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.",
