* Mon Oct 08 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 7.2.1-0
- Added logic to properly handle rsyslogd parameters for V8.6 and later
  as documented in CentOS 7.5 Release notes.  These include moving -x and -w
  options to global.conf and issuing deprecation warning for -l and -s
  options.

  functionality of pki::copy.

* Thu Aug 30 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> 7.2.1-0
- Updated rsyslog::rule::remote to select a more intelligent default
  for StreamDriverPermittedPeers, when TLS is enabled.  This improvement
  fixes the bug in which forwarding of logs to servers in different domains
  was not possible with the stream_driver_permitted_peers default.  Now,
  rsyslog::rule::remote::stream_driver_permitted_peers defaults to 'undef',
  instead of the domain of the Puppet client, and has the following default
  behavior:
  - When all of the remote servers are specified with hostname variants, the
    StreamDriverPermittedPeers directive for the forwarding action for each
    server will be set to that server's hostname.
  - If any of the remote servers is specified as an IP address variant, the
    StreamDriverPermittedPeers directive for the forwarding action for
    each server will be set to the domain of the Puppet client.

* Fri Aug 24 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 7.2.1-0
- Updated the tests to no longer reference sudosh as our custom test since we
  are moving away from using it and it could cause confusion.

* Fri Aug 17 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 7.2.0-0
- Fixed a bug in which removal of a rsyslog::rule from the catalog
  did not cause the rsyslog service to restart, when other rules
  corresponding to files in the same rsyslog configuration
  subdirectory were present.

* Fri Aug 10 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 7.2.0-0
- Reinstated ActionSendStreamDriverMode directive into the global
  configuration when sending TLS-encrypted messages for Rsyslog
  7 version, only. The sending of TLS-encrypted messages for CentOS 6
  will not work otherwise.

* Mon Jul 30 2018 ralph-wright <ralph.wright@onyxpoint.com> - 7.2.0-0
- Remove all ActionSendStreamDriver* directives from the global
  configuration, to allow individual actions to control their specific
  stream settings.  This change was required to allow a host which is
  itself a syslog server to receive TLS-encrypted data, but forward
  these messages to a different remote syslog server as unencrypted data.

  override ensures the network.target and network-online.target units
  are added to the 'Wants' and 'After' lists for the rsyslog.service.

* Fri Mar 16 2018 Philippe Muller <philippe.muller@gmail.com> - 7.1.1-0

  with rsyslog version 7.4.7.  Some versions of rsyslog include
  the ' ' separator in the message payload, which impacts the
  startswith rule.
- Fixed bug whereby puppetserver log messages were not being
  collected in puppetserver-specific logs.

- This is a relatively large update to the rsyslog module that
  (hopefully) fixes the last vestiges of the issues seen with
  multi-server failover and native TLS encryption.
- The main change is that we no longer support using stunnel but,
  instead, rely on native Rsyslog encryption for all actions.
- Message throttling is now *off* by default. This is a site-specific
  need and we just can't guess correctly.

  and was interfering with Logstash.

  rsyslog::global.

  definition of the default message template so that items in
  rsyslog.d can use it directly.

- Moved log forwarder rule (stock/log_server/forward.pp) from /etc/rsyslog.conf
