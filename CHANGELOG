  multi-server failover and native TLS encryption.
- The main change is that we no longer support using stunnel but,
  instead, rely on native Rsyslog encryption for all actions.

  need and we just can't guess correctly.

- Moved log forwarder rule (stock/log_server/forward.pp) from /etc/rsyslog.conf
